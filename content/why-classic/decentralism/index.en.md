## [Key Points](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#key-points)

- Decentralism favors having fewer single points of failure in a system, making it challenging to capture.
- In blockchain systems, decentralization is extremely important. To make a blockchain useful, a certain threshold must be met, depending on the use of the application.
- Many projects use the difficulty of measuring decentralization to obfuscate their true susceptibility to capture.
- Social and technological layers can be captured through various means, so they must also be decentralized.
- Ethereum Classic aims for a sovereign grade level of decentralization, meaning that no worldly organization can capture it.
- Ethereum Classic applies a principles first approach, decentralization maximalism, checks and balances, and protocol neutrality to achieve long-term capture prevention.

## [Introduction](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#introduction)

One of the first publications about the Ethereum Classic that came out after the DAO Hard Fork was [A Crypto-Decentralist Manifesto](https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2016-07-11-crypto-decentralist-manifesto). In protest of The Fork, it underlined the classic decentralized approach to organizing blockchain projects. This document set the tone for ETC's future development. Since its creation, much has been discovered about the nature of the elusive but vital concept.

> Decentralized, Immutable, Unstoppable.

> - Ethereum Classic Website, 2016

This series of buzzwords is a recipe for unlocking the true value potential of blockchain technology. First, you need decentralization, which enables immutability, allowing unstoppability, making possible the [bright future](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/code-is-law) we discussed earlier.

## [Quantifying Decentralization](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#quantifying-decentralization)

> Decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group.
>
> - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization)

Decentralism favors decentralization, a property that exists in many systems and forms throughout nature. It is not a binary property, but a spectrum that ebbs and flows through time. It's difficult to articulate a hard and fast definition for decentralization in all contexts, but it can be visually understood fairly intuitively.

As a system becomes more decentralized, it has fewer chokepoints, making it harder to capture.

In the realm of blockchain projects, there are many ways of measuring decentralization, with one rough quantification being "the ratio of people needed to be compromised in order to take over the system." That is to say, if an attacker wanted to control or censor a chain, a project that required them to compromise 80% of participants is more decentralized than a project that only required 10% to be compromised.

This measurement is known as the [Nakamoto coefficient](https://minima.global/blog/the-nakamoto-coefficient-an-attempt-to-quantify-decentralization), and while it is an excellent conceptual tool, it is a fairly low-resolution one-dimensional measurement. In reality, decentralized systems can be designed to make capture less likely by assigning different groups with different responsibilities. Due to their diversity of responsibilities and backgrounds, difficulty in capturing a network then becomes linked not simply to several people but a complicated mesh of overlapping strengths and weaknesses.

For a more accurate measurement of decentralization, let’s look at an example. For example, Proof of Work blockchains attempt to consider mining by reward, clients by codebase, developers by commits, exchanges by volume, nodes by count, and ownership by value distribution. But, even this more nuanced approach is far from perfect, as a single snapshot measurement does not yield much insight into whether a system can maintain decentralization over time.

Whichever way it is quantified, attackers that wish to "own" the system have a more difficult job the more decentralized a project is. To defend against take-overs, projects need to reach a sufficient level of decentralization, which means minimizing the number of central points of failure and bottlenecks, which can exist in many places in the system.

### [The Blockchain Trilemma](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#the-blockchain-trilemma)

> The underlying structure of decentralized networks comes with unique challenges compared to centralized networks. As early as the 1980s, computer scientists developed the CAP theorem to articulate perhaps the most major of these challenges. According to the CAP theorem, decentralized data stores, of which blockchain is an iteration, can only provide two of three guarantees simultaneously: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP). In modern distributed networks, this theorem has evolved into a blockchain trilemma. This widespread belief is that public blockchains must sacrifice either security, decentralization, or scalability in their infrastructure.
>
> - The Blockchain Trilemma, [Gemini.com](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition#section-what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma)

The Blockchain Trilemma describes a technological limitation that applies to all blockchain protocols. A similar concept also applies to the social layer of a blockchain project, with a sliding scale of top-down versus bottom-up decision-making.

Like creating a video game character, all projects must place themselves somewhere in the space of these sociotechnological dimensions, allocating ability points and sacrificing some attributes for others. The selection defines a blockchain's class, abilities, and effectiveness in battle.

As we will see, as far as the protocol's attributes and underlying philosophy goes, Ethereum Classic has maxed out its decentralization and security, intentionality sacrificing both scalability and other top-down social organizational more essential skills can be strengthened.

These skills were maxed-out because, for a blockchain protocol to scale its base protocol, it must make trade-offs in decentralization and security, which may not appear as apparent costs immediately. In the long run, it is bound to damage the utility and value of the network. In short, for ETC, scalability is less important than security and decentralization, and this technical trade-off is also mirrored in the social layer. Decentralization is above the expediency of central rule.

Today, most blockchain projects have abandoned the idea of maxing-out decentralization in exchange for scalability and the benefits of coordinating from a central group. This may well be useful for short term bootstrapping as it allows the funding of extravagant development or marketing budgets, but unless the project tapers-off this dependence on centralization, which may be impossible due to the incentivization structures it creates, the network is exposed to take-over through the capture of this relatively centralized setup.

### [Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#sovereign-grade-censorship-resistance)

One question that should be asked when evaluating different blockchain projects is, "is it decentralized enough?" The answer to this entirely depends on the use case's [threat model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model), which relies on the kind of applications intended to run on a given chain. The question can be reframed as "who would want to stop the applications on this chain from running, and can the chain resist their attempts at censorship?"

For example, in the case of Bitcoin, its main application is the coin itself: digital scarcity and the ability to transfer it without censorship. It competes with many currencies and assets, including the US dollar, and, therefore, must withstand attacks from powerful entities to persist. Many of Bitcoin's [predecessors](https://blog.dassetx.com/the-known-and-possible-influences-of-satoshi-nakamoto-part-1-privately-issued-digital-currencies-before-bitcoin) were shut down because they had central points of failure, and Bitcoin was explicitly designed to circumvent this kind of censorship by being sufficiently decentralized.

In contrast, some blockchains require less censorship resistance than Bitcoin and only intend to, for example, enable the transfer of virtual baseball cards, or have other uncontroversial use cases. No powerful external forces want to stop these applications, so censorship resistance is unnecessary. It may even be seen as a benefit if some central party can override the state of the chain in certain circumstances. So, having the whole chain operated by a handful of authorities is acceptable for this use case. In these cases, where the use case is not important enough for well-funded organizations to shut down, it might make sense to sacrifice decentralization for scalability, and other non-blockchain technologies may be more appropriate.

Ethereum Classic, even back in 2015, when it was known as Ethereum, set out to achieve ambitions on a level at least as prone to censorship as Bitcoin.

> Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that executes smart contracts. Applications are run precisely as programmed without the possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference.
>
> - Ethereum.org, 2015

Ethereum’s Smart Contract Platform was designed to support Bitcoin’s base currency use case and any kind of blockchain application. Because of this, it is highly likely to attract attempts at censorship from legacy system incumbents at risk of being disrupted.

To provide a solution on a global level that would need to stave off attacks from other sovereign institutions, such as nation-states and multinational organizations, Ethereum, like Bitcoin, would need to reach a level of decentralization that made it impossible for any of these groups to censor it. Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance is required.

A critical threshold is reached with this level of uncensorability. As no other institution can censor the network, applications become significantly more useful, becoming trustless. They no longer rely on the trust or permission of some other company or government to operate, and, on these platforms, it is the users, rather than the providers who get to decide what goes on.

Code is Law can only operate on a chain that has achieved Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance. This level is required to prevent other entities from censoring its operation, and this, in turn, requires the chain to max out its decentralization attributes and constantly maintains them without compromise. Code is Law requires decentralization maximalism.

## [Centralization Failure States](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#centralization-failure-states)

Before we explore the solution to the problem of centralization, we must first understand how a lack of decentralization can quickly regress into full-blown failure.

Today, even more so than when Ethereum Classic was launched in 2015, it is increasingly apparent that censorship is becoming the weapon of choice of a dying legacy system that desperately attempts to cling to relevance. As these old institutions become increasingly threatened by change, it seems likely that ever-more drastic measures will be taken to defend their position.

Before blockchain technology entered the scene, these institutions had reality pretty much on lockdown as society was heavily reliant on centralized control points for value and information transfer, which was readily exploited. With cryptography, Satoshi answered this for us just in the nick of time, providing humanity with an alternative emergent order.

As time goes on, the attacks against free, fair, and open alternatives to the status quo will ramp up. As a result, the cryptocurrency ecosystem will enter a new phase, a highly antagonistic phase, where the uncensorability of blockchain technology will truly be put to the test, and the central points of failure in cryptocurrency systems that have them will be sought out and exploited. For use cases that incumbents disapprove, only the Sovereign Grade will survive.

In the future, to maintain utility and value, blockchains must resist a range of social, economic, and technological attacks that will be deployed against them. The list of attacks is ever-growing, and new forms of attack are sure to be conjured up, but, at the very least, the more obvious failure states must be avoided.

### [The Ephemeral Foundation](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#the-ephemeral-foundation)

Historically, the number one cause of death for blockchain projects is when the teams responsible for maintaining them no longer operate. Simply put, if a project depends on a central organizing committee or developer team, it will only last for as long as that organization does.

Organizations can cease to operate for many reasons. Be it a simple rug pull, running out of funds, getting hacked, getting hammered by regulators, traffic accidents, or any other reason, these factors are often outside the control of this team, so it is down to luck or the approval of regulators whether a project can survive.

In many cases, the existence of a central team disincentives others from contributing to a project, as they are not on a level playing field. Third parties will always be second class citizens compared to this central organizing committee, who are calling the shots and disproportionately benefitting from price action in the case of a premine or development tax, which further solidifies reliance on this team to maintain and direct the project, and, at the very least, prevents a natural organizational hierarchy from emerging.

This reliance on a central team may provide direction and big budgets in the short term, but it burdens the protocol with a kind of "centralization debt" that is difficult to pay off. Eventually, like all organizations, the central team will cease to operate. Unless the project sheds this reliance, it is likely to become either abandoned or maladapted to life without this group.

### [Meatspace Capture](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#meatspace-capture)

For high-value projects that have an overreliance on centralized teams, as time goes on, a fate far more insidious than mere abandonment becomes increasingly likely. Like clockwork, as with all top-down centralized institutions, they become captured by special interests through various manipulative techniques.

Suppose a powerful institution feels threatened by new technology, rather than stamping it out, which may be impossible. In that case, it is far more effective to simply compromise and disrupt its operation by influencing the direction of development in a way that does not fundamentally upset the status quo.

This can be achieved by turning influencers, and the leadership of an organization into puppets whose strings are pulled through a variety of carrots and sticks. Humans are fallible and are susceptible to all degrees of manipulation and extortion, peer pressure, angry mobs, politics, kickbacks, bribes, psyops, honey traps, kompromat, physical threats, imprisonment, or worse.

With enough critical targets under the thumb of an attacker, they can control the future of a chain through their authority, making subtle, incremental changes that further increase their grip and control over decision-making.

One of the most problematic elements of this type of failure state is that it can be done in a way that is undetectable. It may be that the level to which a central team is compromised is unknown and capture only becomes obvious when it is too late to do anything about it.

Even if a centralized team is not overtly compromised, the very potential of this compromise can sow distrust and uneasiness. Conspiracy theories and the questioning of decision-making may undermine a project's leadership and stability if they appear not to be driven by merit alone and simple divide and conquer tactics deployed against the organizing committee may be enough to paralyze the project.

This failure state shows an inherent contradiction within any blockchain project that relies on a central organizing committee. While the protocol may be decentralized on paper, the project is dependent on a central group that can and will be bent to the will of anyone who feels that the cost of doing so is worth it.

### [Kabuki Coins](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#kabuki-coins)

Centralization, like gravity, is constantly pulling and looking for any weakness in a sociotechnological structure to find its breaking point. For a system to overcome this force long term, it must ensure that no central point of failure can be exploited, which means designing robust countermeasures that constantly push back against centralization not just in one place but in all areas.

Because of this, there is no point in having decentralization in half measures. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and a blockchain is only as decentralized as its most centralized bottleneck. For this reason, all parts of a blockchain project, both technically and socially, must strive for Decentralization Maximalism.

Unfortunately, within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the importance of Decentralization Maximalism is not widely understood or adopted, to the point where the term Decentralization Theater has become a common way to describe many so-called decentralized systems.

These projects have subtle but centralized single points of failure within their systems, but promoters shift the focus to other "decentralized" areas. This is an effective tactic, as proving that a system has potentially capturable central points of failure requires intimate knowledge of the system and can be very difficult or impossible for the layman due to the technical skill and insider knowledge required to evaluate properly.

Like the parable of the buildings built on rock and sand, to the untrained eye, two projects may appear to be properly constructed, and, under normal conditions, they both operate as intended. But under the surface, one project has a fatal flaw that will only lead to ruin in times of stress and will likely end up causing damage to those who expect the project to stand the test of time.

![Blockchains, like buildings, can be built on strong and weak foundations](./rocksand.jpeg)

## [Classic Problems Require Classic Solutions](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#classic-problems-require-classic-solutions)

Corruption is a problem as old as civilization. While it might not have reared its ugly head in the cryptocurrency space yet, as the technology becomes more influential, it is bound to attract forces that wish to bridle its power and shape it towards a future where, far from liberating humanity, blockchains become tools for optimizing enslavement.

In the long run, whatever happens, decentralized blockchains will prevail eventually. Still, if humanity wishes to avoid a dark-ages style period of hampered innovation and stagnation, the word must be spread about the dangers of centralization so that it can be dealt with before they take hold. Luckily, a window of opportunity exists to counter the inevitable ongoing attempts to capture blockchains. For now, projects that strive for Decentralization Maximalism still exist and are available to those who wish to use them.

While it's still voluntary, rather than relying on authority figures or marketing campaigns, individuals can reason from first principles and reflect on lessons from the past to reach their conclusions about which blockchains are likely to provide long-term value and are worth interacting with.

By going back to the roots of blockchain technology, economic theory, and the lessons of history, the wisdom in the designs decisions behind Bitcoin becomes clear, and this logic can be reapplied to other technological advancements in the space, including Smart Contract Platforms such as Ethereum Classic.

### [Principles First](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#principles-first)

While institutions and the humans that make them are fallible, fickle, and fragile, ideas are bulletproof. It is self-evident that technology is as important and influential as blockchain must be built upon something more than just people. A well-developed philosophy must back it to guide the actions of otherwise capturable bags of meat.

Good ideas stand on their own, can be debated in public, and are valid regardless of who proclaims them, making them perfect for constructing a harness to restrain and protect the future of a blockchain project. That is why Ethereum Classic's Foundation is not a group, but its core principles come first and inform decision-making.

Pragmatism is downstream of maintaining and adhering to sound principles, as they enable both practical survivability, long-term sustainability, and act as a form of advertising that attracts quality contributors. The principles first approach goes a long way to ensuring that a project can maintain its course for many generations to come, as it is guided not by the ever-changing interests of a central group, but by external philosophical reference points that, even with high a turnover of contributors, can be perpetuated and refined in public to direct the future of the project.

Having no central group to call the shots means that any individual or group can fill any role, as long as they are faithfully interpreting and executing ETC's principles and values, as understood by stakeholders. If some feel that a hard fork diverges from the values they signed up for, they can continue the existing version of the chain. The risk of a chain split means all participants are incentivized to work together to solve differences. Still, neither side can of a debate overrule the other if the disagreement is unresolvable.

### [Decentralization Maximalism](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#decentralization-maximalism)

Decentralization Maximalism is the only known mechanism to shore off the forces of centralization long term. It is not a predefined set of rules but is a general philosophy or way of thinking that seeks to reduce the number of central points of failure throughout a system.

It demands that decentralization be perused holistically in all areas, in the protocol’s design, and the social layer, where possible. The goal is to make the protocol secure from take-over and the social layer secure from capture. Satoshi Nakamoto being anonymous and going silent is the classic example of this philosophy being applied to the Bitcoin project, the success of which is wise to emulate.

Where it makes sense, by definition, this approach demands no compromise. Even the smallest of sacrifices, infractions, or exceptions should be, unless entirely unavoidable with some overall worthwhile trade-off in the context of known stopping criteria, intolerable. Unfortunately, as centralization is challenging to get rid of, it typically accumulates over time and will pile up until the system becomes captured in one way or another.

Whatever the crossroad, Decentralization Maximalism requires eternal vigilance and the knowledge that systems naturally tend towards centralization, so every decision made must consider the cost paid in centralization debt to keep the system debt-free long term.

### [Balancing Power](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#balancing-power)

As echoed by the structure of existing institutions, such as the government of the United States of America, to rein in bad decision-making and prevent one group from hijacking a system as a whole for its interests, a balance of power between different players needs to exist in systems that wish to maintain longevity. This concept is known as checks and balances.

![The US Government is an example of a system that implements Checks and Balances](./congress.png)

As with the US government, checks and balances are an essential feature of Proof of Work blockchains, where three major power groups exist and balance each other's power.

| Group      | Role                                      | Veto                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Developers | Maintain clients and infrastructure       | Stop maintaining code  |
| Miners     | Provide security against 51% attacks      | Mine a different chain |
| Financiers | Provide liquidity and finance initiatives | Sell holdings          |

The alignment of three major powers in Proof of Work blockchains provides stability. They each add value to the system in entirely different ways. Each holds the system to account through the veto power, which ensures that no other groups can screw things up too severely. Whether a government or a blockchain, things tend to go wrong when these checks and balances are removed.

Note that this configuration of three is important, as it also means that the group can overcome consensus issues through a simple majority vote. This odd-number electorate is a common pattern in distributed systems. A deadlock can ensue with only two participants, as each side vetoes the other, and no third party can resolve the dispute.

Three is a magic number. It creates a beautiful symphony of balanced power held together by a system of competing interests that incentivize either voluntary engagement or ostracism of bad behavior.

Miners provide security and get a block reward, which only has value if the network is useful thanks to developers and other providers maintaining the protocol and building out infrastructure facilitated by traders providing liquidity and investors speculating and funding projects.

Like struts holding up the base of a tower, these well-placed incentives rely on each other for support. Together, as long as they are correctly distributed, they can yield a new structure greater than the sum of their parts and can stand potentially for millennia.

On top of this, a diversity of roles makes a system more challenging to take down by encouraging participation from parties with differing interests, profiles, and weaknesses. As multiple layers of defense, the more diverse the pool of participants secures blockchain, the harder it is for an attacker to compromise. A diversity of weaknesses requires a diversity of attacks, and a higher cost is needed to capture the system. Even with the same number of participants, a system with more separation of concerns can be more decentralized and difficult to capture because of this diversity.

The blueprint introduced by Bitcoin was also used by many other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, which essentially copied the fundamentals, tweaked some variables, and (brilliantly) added a Turing-complete virtual machine, the EVM. Much like an architectural blueprint encoding the structure of a real world-building, it would be seemingly unwise to remove one or more of the critical struts preventing the structure from collapsing into a centralized mess.

If a project wants to survive long term, it must have enough of these necessary incentive structure struts to be properly balanced. If Bitcoin is a sturdy tripod made of miners, developers, and traders, by sawing off one of these legs, for example, by switching to Proof of Stake and firing the miners, the result is a two-legged barstool, one that can be straddled for a while, but even the faintest breeze will cause it to become a dangerous liability.

### [The Neutrality Competition](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#the-neutrality-competition)

As the night is young in the blockchain game, the problem of [Ephemeral Foundations](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#the-ephemeral-foundation) may not be so obvious. But, whether conned, crushed, or otherwise captured, the noble intentions that run the show for many blockchain projects are certain to come to an end, and with them, if their chains are not able to shed reliance, so do their ambitions.

This problem is made worse when the decision-making systems within a blockchain project rely on a central group for extended periods. Alternative mechanisms for organizing the project cannot evolve, as decision-making is expected to come from the top-down rather than bottom-up. As a result, opaque autocracy becomes the standard, which ossifies and becomes fragile, rather than allowing for an anti-fragile open meritocracy to flourish.

This manifests in the Centralization Gravity Well instance, where reliance on central decision-making snowballs as outside contribution becomes more difficult. Hence, the project relies more and more heavily on top-down leadership, and the cycle repeats.

Because of this, in the future, projects that rely on centralized organizations will take one by one fall victim to this reliance, and the truth will be realized that only projects without this reliance can sustain themselves for long periods. As the wild valuations that cryptocurrencies currently enjoy depending on the hope that these projects have some degree of longevity, it will become increasingly evident that only truly decentralized projects are worth contributing money, talent, or time to, and the market will reallocate accordingly.

Only the projects with long-term value propositions will remain, which means only those without relying on central organizing committees will remain. By the same logic, it will become apparent that, all things being equal, the projects perceived to be the least dependent on central groups will attract the most contribution and value.

Instead of relying on unsustainable cash injections from central authorities, projects must evolve purely on natural contributions, such as those through the Buy and Contribute strategy, whereby individuals buy into a project and economically incentivize themselves to contribute to it.

This strategy works best when an individual is reaping the full reward of their contribution, which can only happen when a protocol is neutral. It treats all participants on equal footing and does not grant special privileges on a protocol layer to specific parties. Decentralized blockchain projects will compete with each other on this basis. Only the most neutral projects, those without foundation, Dev Tax, or undiluted premine, will attract the type of natural contribution that enables long-term sustainability.

## [Onward](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#onward)

If humanity wishes to avoid another dark age, it must embrace systems that can resist the corrupt forces threatening to capture blockchain technology’s future. Of course, only systems that strive for Decentralization Maximalism can achieve this, but of all blockchain projects that exist today, only a handful recognize this requirement.

Theinnovations that Ethereum brought to the world in the form of a Turing Complete Smart Contract Platform provide a great leap forward in terms of the utility and potential of blockchain uses cases, but as evidenced the DAO Fork and the switch to Proof of Stake, the direction the project is being taken makes it susceptible to capture and unable to achieve Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance.

In the not too distant future, as attacks against blockchains ramp up, this need will be all too clear. As one by one, so-called decentralized projects reveal their true colors and succumb to corruption in the form of capture by special interests. As a result, only the genuinely decentralized will remain.

By combining the technology of Ethereum™ with the philosophy of Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic provides a secure, multipurpose, decentralized blockchain, and a free, fair, and flourishing alternative to what might be a grim and centralized future.

# ETH + BTC = ETC

Feb 21, 2022

Opinionated Content

## [Key Points](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/eth-btc-etc#key-points)

-   Ethereum Classic, existing in response to centralization, quickly realized and adopted the genius of Bitcoin's decentralist design decisions.
-   Like ETH, ETC is a Turing Complete Smart Contract Platform.
-   Like BTC, ETC has a miraculous origin, which is impossible to recreate.
-   Like BTC, ETC has “no official anything,” preventing “official” capture.
-   Like BTC, ETC aims to provide reliable secure base layer and does so by upgrading the protocol conservatively.
-   Like BTC, ETC requires constant skepticism in community interactions.
-   Some in the ETC community believe _toxicity_ is a legitimate way to inoculate bad actors in an adversarial context.

## [Introduction](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/eth-btc-etc#introduction)

For those already somewhat familiar with the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a quite simple heuristic exists that cuts to the chase of what Ethereum Classic is attempting to achieve.

Ethereum Classic takes the philosophy of Bitcoin and applies it to the technology of Ethereum.

- The CEO of Ethereum Classic, if one existed.

![ETH + BTC = ETC](./panda.png)

ETH + BTC = ETC

Many of those involved with Ethereum before the DAO Hack was under the impression that Ethereum was hoping to do precisely this: be built on top of the well-established core ideas that Bitcoin provided but add on additional functionality in the form of a Turing Complete Smart Contract Platform.

But as the DAO Hack showed, this was not the case. What is now known as Ethereum™ has very little to do with the decentralist values that Bitcoin was created to embody.

The decision for the Ethereum Foundation to abandon the decentralist values that were used to entice contributions was unfortunate but created a vacuum that ultimately further refined the meaning and importance of those values and birthed a project whose mission was to continue that _Original Ethereum Vision_.

Ethereum Classic, even more so than Bitcoin itself, exists as an explicit reminder about the importance of decentralist values. There were many who didn't understand their significance at the time, but many others saw the truth that decentralization was the very point, not just an annoying obstacle to overcome.

Since the chain split, the design choices and philosophy of Ethereum Classic have come to recognize the genius decisions made when constructing the original Bitcoin protocol. As much as possible, emulates this success in the pursuit of decentralism and real-world achievements that followed.

## [Immaculate Conception 2.0](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/eth-btc-etc#immaculate-conception-2-0)

Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic can be considered a divine entity due to the circumstances of its miraculous origin.

As explored [earlier](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/genesis#the-immaculate-conception), Ethereum Classic's creation story is almost certainly impossible to recreate or happen by accident ever again. Not only were the events leading up to its birth extremely improbable, but ETC's very existence now serves as a warning to other projects, which are likely to avoid similar controversial hard forks, or at least only do them while mitigating the possibility of a chain split.

There were no markets and therefore no monetary value, and with this, it has not corrupted by the profit incentive from inception.  
...  
This is not the case with other coins [except ETC]. All launched with founders looking to profit, having backing from investors looking for bit exits, and naturally retail foaming at the mouth looking to flip their positions.

-   [The Bitcoin Manual, Why There Won't Be A Next Bitcoin](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/why-there-wont-be-a-next-bitcoin/)

In some ways, Ethereum Classic's conception is even more "immaculate" than Bitcoin's; it was not planned at all, by anyone, and unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic has no Satoshi, meaning that there is no Satoshi to return and influence decision-making, which is theoretically possible in Bitcoin.

Ethereum Classic is also the only blockchain project seeded with a follower base that was 100% focused on the principles of decentralism. Despite the risks, it went against the official Ethereum™ project, self-selecting specifically because of their reaction to The DAO incident and the abuses enabled by centralization.

## [No Official Anything](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/eth-btc-etc#no-official-anything)

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic has no official developers, maintainers, or leaders. It has no official logo, no official website, no official conferences. Ethereum Classic _cannot_ have an official _anything_ because no individual or group has the authority to claim they represent ETC in any official capacity.

This is a rare quality and massive strength in the world of blockchains. It means no official _thing_ that can be taken down, captured, or compromised, and there is no official entity that can sue competing forks for copyright infringement.

_No official anything_ is the source of much of the strength of the Ethereum Classic project, but it also has drawbacks as there is no central source of truth to coordinate from. Instead, a democracy exists where anyone can contribute and based on what is done, picked up, and used, it becomes what makes up Ethereum Classic. This makes it a unique project and attractive to contributors. Nothing can stop _you_ from being as close to official as anyone else.

## [Secure Base Layer](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/eth-btc-etc#secure-base-layer)

The view of many within the Ethereum Classic community is that the aforementioned [Blockchain Trilemma](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#the-blockchain-trilemma) is insurmountable, at least on the base later. For this reason, Ethereum Classic's current roadmap does not include the more exotic "solutions" that will be attempted by Ethereum™.

Sharding is one example, where contracts are siloed into their execution environments and executed in parallel. In theory, this idea seems plausible, but for that added complexity, there are many trade-offs. It is not suitable for globally interoperable contracts, including many of today's valuable systems that need shared execution, such as anything that touches Decentralized Finance liquidity.

Essentially, there is no known _one size fits all_ approach to scaling throughput that can be applied on the base layer without compromising an important security assumption, so for ETC as a protocol, barring some significant technological advancement, it is best left up to applications or secondary protocols to provide various different trade-offs and implement their optimizations depending on the use case and the needs of users.

Many in the Ethereum Classic community are also wary of attempts to increase the block size due to the adverse effects that are likely to appear down the road in terms of "bloat" and the increased _time to sync_ and hardware requirements, which, if left unchecked, may make it difficult to run an Ethereum Classic node, leading to centralization. Some argue the block gas limit should be reduced further, while others look towards _Zero Knowledge Proof_ technologies that can reduce the amount of data needed to be stored on-chain.

There is general agreement that a layered approach to scaling blockchains can increase throughput while satisfying the _Blockchain Trilemma_ in a way that does not mess with the base layer. Individuals can experiment with different "L2" systems that provide various trade-offs depending on the application and user requirements.

## [KISS Slowly](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/eth-btc-etc#kiss-slowly)

The base layer needs to be secure in several ways, both technologically stable with fewer bugs and socioeconomically secure against various forms of attacks.

Because single points of failure can exist in many areas and are often hidden, all things being equal, it is easier to maintain decentralization in _fewer complex systems_. Additional complexity not just creates more potential for technical bugs and exploits, but also for central points of failure, in unforeseen game-theory quandaries and in the form of higher upkeep requirements leading to a reduced pool of developers able to contribute to maintenance; if a system is too complex for anyone to reason with, it may as well be captured by its authors, who have sole authority on how it should be operated, maintained, and upgraded.

Bitcoin, as with ETC, positions itself as the "good old reliable" system that does not need to innovate quickly but instead do so slowly and methodically without breaking any of its previously established guarantees. This is achieved through a conservative approach to protocol upgrades, a "Move Slowly and Don't Break Things" ethos, and the delivery of innovation in layers rather than attempting to implement radical changes to the base protocol.

Like Bitcoin, this approach does not preclude innovation. Instead, it simply demands a careful and methodical [approach](https://ethereumclassic.org/knowledge/future#upgrade-process) to protocol upgrades.

## [Don't Trust, Verify](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/eth-btc-etc#dont-trust-verify)

One of the hallmarks of decentralized projects in the social layer is that a healthy distrust exists amongst participants. While this may sound counter-intuitive, it secures the social layer against many forms of attack.

Any individual could become compromised at any point, so all participants must maintain an ever-skeptical perspective in communications and decision-making, judging _ideas_ rather than individuals and reputations. To do otherwise is to make one of the key failures of centralized decision-making, which may be expedient, but is fragile, as when decisions are made based on authority rather than merit alone, it allows terrible decisions not just to occur occasionally, but continue unchecked, double-downed on, and snowball out of control.

For this reason, the concept of "Toxic Bitcoin Maximalism" as a general approach to the adversarial cryptocurrency social space remains an open debate and is considered by some to be a simple, valid, albeit unsavory strategy for navigating discussions. Some consider toxicity a form of immune response that weeds out certain types of smooth-talking bad actors who rely on populism to forward a particular proposal. Toxicity is not compatible with all personalities, and the Ethereum Classic has its fair share of both toxic and non-toxic participants. Be advised that in most cases, abrasiveness in the cryptocurrency space is not personal, but on the contrary, about defaulting to a purely idea-based rather than personality-based discussion.

----------

Next, let's take a closer look at some practical technical implementation details that Ethereum Classic has adopted thanks to inspiration from Bitcoin, Sound Money, and Proof of Work.

# Sound Money

Feb 21, 2022

Opinionated Content

## [Key Points](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money#key-points)

-   Sound Money is a concept predating the internet that inspired the invention of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.
-   Money can be considered sound if it has several quantifiable properties, and these properties are encoded into ETC.
-   One important property is _scarcity_, which ETC gets from its _fixed emission curve_ leading to a _known future supply_.
-   If a project does not have a _known future supply_, maintainers can arbitrarily inflate the value of a currency away from holders.
-   This risk remains present on all chains that do not have a _fixed emissions curve_, including Ethereum™.

## [Introduction](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money#introduction)

The backbone of strong economies, the provider of stability, the incentiviser of healthy [time preference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5XbLm3pEfI), the creator of prosperity. Sound money is the antidote to many of the problems created by the financial abuses of centralization in the wider world and is the core concept that spurred the creation of Bitcoin.

From the [Austrian School of Economics](https://mises.org/topics/bitcoin), many of the theories behind Bitcoin, including [Sound Money](https://mises.org/library/principle-sound-money) saw their philosophical gestation. Decades before Bitcoin was technologically conceivable, economists such as Ludwig von Mises, Fredreick Hayak, and Milton Friedman were professing the dangers of fiat money and the advantage of systems of finance that are free from manipulation central authorities.

## [Properties of Sound Money](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money#properties-of-sound-money)

Money is the lifeblood of transporting energy and information around the system in an economy, which is why the well-designed currency is critical for a functional society. It was identified that money must serve three purposes: as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange. These three functions are facilitated by several [properties](https://cryptowhat.com/properties-of-sound-money/), which were intentionally engineered into the design of Bitcoin and inherited by ETC:

-   Divisibility: ETC is divisible up to 18 decimal places. This means that ETC can be split into 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 smaller units if needed. Denominations of ETC can be written in Wei, the smallest ETC unit currently available.
-   Transferability: Since ETC isn’t tied to any banks or governments, it’s easily transferable across countries and between users on a global scale. This gives ETC an advantage over paper money and precious metals, which aren't as easily transferable across long distances.
-   Fungibility: Each ETC is worth precisely what it’s valued at on the market. One ETC won’t have different values based on previous ETC transactions—unlike some currencies where older bills are often worth less than newer ones. This is called fungibility, and it’s a property ETC shares with physical commodities like gold and silver.
-   Durability: ETC is incredibly durable. It is ultimately just information to be stored on a computer or in a digital wallet or even offline on a piece of paper or metal. This makes ETC much more durable than traditional forms of money like paper currency, easily destroyed or lost.
-   Portability: ETC is highly portable. You can carry it on a thumb drive, phone, write it down on paper, or remember it as a seed phrase.
-   Scarcity: ETC has a finite supply that will be released over time. This makes ETC scarcer than most other forms of currency.

## [Known Future Supply](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money#known-future-supply)

ETC has all the properties of Sound Money. It’s decentralized, uncensorable, divisible, transferable, fungible, durable, and scarce. The cornerstone of a blockchain's sound monetary policy is scarcity via a _known future supply_. Just like Bitcoin, but unlike Ethereum™, Classic has a _fixed emission curve_. A [fixed amount](https://etcis.money/) of ETC is created as a block reward for miners, which means that holders of ETC can accurately calculate the total amount of ETC in existence at any point in time.

Ethereum Classic's fixed emission curve was introduced by [ECIP-1017](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1017). The emission schedule, also known as 5M20, reduces the block reward by 20% every 5,000,000 blocks. Socially, this block reward reduction event has taken the moniker of "The Fifthening."

| Est. Date      | 5M20 Era | Block      | Block Reward | Total Era Emission     |
|----------------|----------|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 2015-07-30     | Era 1    | 1          | 5 ETC        | 25,000,000 ETC         |
| 2017-12-11     | Era 2    | 5,000,001  | 4 ETC        | 20,000,000 ETC         |
| 2020-03-17     | Era 3    | 10,000,001 | 3.2 ETC      | 16,000,000 ETC         |
| 2022-04-15     | Era 4    | 15,000,001 | 2.56 ETC     | 12,800,000 ETC         |
| 2024-05-07     | Era 5    | 20,000,001 | 2.048 ETC    | 10,240,000 ETC         |
| ~Every 2 Years | N+1      | +5,000,000 | -20%         | Total ~200,000,000 ETC |

_Note: due to fluctuating uncle rate, the exact emission amount will deviate slightly, but not significantly._

A _fixed emissions curve_ means that the rate of inflation is predictable, and in the case of ETC, is continually decreasing over time. As the value of the network increases, the value of all ETC increases predictably according to this rate, rather than some unknown future rate that could be much higher. ETC's commitment to a fixed emission curve is enshrined into both the protocol and its social layer, and thanks to Proof of Work, any hard fork that attempts to manipulate inflation will result in a permeant chain split, massively disincentivizing such a change to the point of it being _extremely_ unlikely to be contemplated, let alone be attempted, let alone be successful.

In blockchains, a _known future supply_ provides a prosperous alternative to the legacy fiat system, and a critical sociotechnological role in the systems that utilize it as the basis for keeping a project decentralized. The monetary policy of a blockchain is a standard agreement that all participants voluntarily engage with. It keeps all parties aligned economically and prevents groups from accumulating undue influence over others. Its unwavering neutrality is what keeps all participants on an equal footing.

## [Unsound Money](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/sound-money#unsound-money)

Be it fiat or cryptocurrencies, redistribution of funds via inflation or currency debasement is one of the oldest tricks in the book for meddling central planners with a misplaced sense of authority. In times of trouble, they inevitably use this mechanism to ensure that when the ship goes down, those who control the keys to the castle will be the first on the life rafts, as they can redistribute whatever dregs of value remain to themselves at the expense of holders of the currency, all in the name of safety and stability, of course.

This failure state is a type of rug pull that can only exist in projects that are not sufficiently decentralized. The redistribution of value away from holders to some specific group (be it miners, stakers, or developers) can only happen when the [balance of power](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#balancing-power) is uneven. Some participants can push through changes to the protocol that put their interests before others.

Sound money, and its ability to hold value over time, is a core property of the incentivization mechanisms that encourage participation, as while it does not guarantee that an asset will appreciate, it at least provides a means to calculate future earnings potential given the future growth of a project. It _does_ guarantee that holders will benefit from a project's upside.

Some projects do not have a _known future supply_, which means the risk of [Zimbabwe-like hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an ever-present dark cloud that hangs over all holders of the currency. Although, these projects may not need to turn on the inflation tap, it may become "necessary" for whatever reason in the future. Be it development funding issues or the [race to the bottom](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#the-apr-arms-race) of competing with other chains’ Proof of Stake yields. Without the precedent of a fixed emission curve, the central organizing committee of such projects can easily conjure up any number of justifications for appropriating value from holders as the only way for the project to continue.

![currency](./currency.jpeg)

A One-Hundred Trillion Zimbabwe Dollar Note

Some promoters of cryptocurrencies, perhaps unintentionally, gaslight their fellow holders into believing that the checks and balances provided by _fixed future supply_ are a hindrance. It is somehow in the financial interests of holders not to have one.

The idea of _ultrasound money_, a synonym of _unsound money_, means that the future supply of a currency is unknown. While maintainers pinky promise that it will never be higher than it needs to be, that could be anything from zero to infinity. Furthermore, an _ultrasound_ future supply is subject to tinkering based on an undefined and unpredictable criterion, meaning its central authority reserves the unrestricted right to redistribute funds away from holders in the future.

Yeah, your boring old car might be safe, but check out this bad boy over here. We removed the breaks and seat belts, so now it is ultrasafe.

Regrettably, in contrast with Ethereum Classic, perhaps to provide optionality in the future for attracting Proof of Stake yield, Ethereum™ is one of many cryptocurrency projects that maintains a policy of _unknown future supply_, which in turn means that holders are exposed to the risk of unbounded future inflation.

# Proof of Work

Feb 21, 2022

Opinionated Content

## [Key Points](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#key-points)

-   Ethereum Classic is committed to remaining on Proof of Work indefinitely, towards _Decentralization Maximalism._
-   Proof of Work is a tried and true consensus mechanism, the only one known to provide _Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance._
-   Candidly, the decision to use Proof of Stake is likely financially motivated, rather than the given reason of environmental concern.
-   Proof of Stake comes with known security trade-offs, including additional complexity, 33% attacks, vulnerability to financial attacks, centralization of staking, the APR arms race, nothing at stake, removal of checks and balances, and the rich get richer.

## [Introduction](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#introduction)

On a technical level, one of the biggest differentiators between Ethereum Classic and its sibling Ethereum™ is ETC's commitment to remain on Proof of Work. Some might assume that this is due to a lack of development, ambition, or ability to move to a "more advanced" Proof of Stake system. Still, this section aims to dispel that myth by explaining the reasoning behind Ethereum Classic's very intentional decision to stay with Proof of Work in the name of decentralization and security.

## [Classic Solutions](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#classic-solutions)

The most important technical component of Ethereum Classic, as with all valuable blockchains, is Proof of Work. The only known consensus mechanism that can provide the qualities needed to approach _Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance_. The application of Proof of Work as a consensus mechanism for Blockchain execution was the keystone crowning achievement in the genius design of Bitcoin. Its application solved the [Byzantine Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault), and, thus, provided a decentralized solution to double-spending, a discovery that made blockchain technology as we know it viable.

Proof of Work chains have been operating faithfully for over a decade and, with enough hashrate, have shown to be unstoppable even by powerful nation-states. Presently, no party on the planet can conventionally muster the electricity and hardware required to launch a sustained attack against Bitcoin's consensus mechanism, which makes it _sovereign_.

Proof of Work is not designed to be 100% "perfect," and as with all systems, it has a limited set of guarantees. Most famously, Proof of Work chains are subject to 51% attacks, which Ethereum Classic has fallen victim to on multiple occasions, yet ETC continues, nonetheless. Attacks of 51% are a feature, not a bug. Accepting them is the trade-off required to allow for objective computer-verifiable rules about which version of a chain should be considered "correct"; whichever has the most hashrate contributed to it, regardless of who contributes that hashrate.

Notably, the security guarantees made by Proof of Work chains are explicit, simple, and verifiable, and, as such, are easy to reason with, meaning the average user can understand the threat model that Proof of Work chains are designed to operate under and whether their needs can be met.

The timeless wisdom of “_if it ain't broke, don't fix it,”_ comes to mind, and there must be a seriously important reason to change this state of affairs.

## [Compromised Consensus](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#compromised-consensus)

The title of this page should probably be "Not Proof of Stake," as from here on, we will justify Ethereum Classic's decision to remain on Proof of Work as Ethereum™ [switches](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) to Proof of Stake.

In short, Proof of Work is a battle-tested and theoretically sound consensus mechanism that prioritizes and can deliver on the critical qualities that give rise to a blockchain's utility and value proposition. On the other hand, Proof of Stake sacrifices these elements in return for prioritizing non-critical secondary ideals, such as reducing carbon emissions or maximizing returns for large whales.

Nothing epitomizes the subtle and insidious nature of centralization like the myth of Proof of Stake. On the surface, it is a noble attempt to correct the worst of blockchain technology and make it compatible with a sustainable future, but upon closer inspection, this dangerous idea sacrifices the most liberating aspect of the tech in exchange for less than noble objectives.

In reality, the popularity of Proof of Stake risks not only squandering time and resources, but if its adoption proceeds unchallenged, Proof of Stake could condemn the future to one that operates on captured systems masquerading as neutral; where developments in the cryptocurrency space contribute not towards human flourishing but to the ever-growing power of an ultra-elite, at the expense of open utility for all.

## [The Engine of the Future](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#the-engine-of-the-future)

A blockchain's consensus mechanism is its engine. It is the most critical piece of technological infrastructure, from which all security, value, and utility depend on. Like an engine, if it stops working correctly, all other systems that rely on its functioning become useless, or worse, a danger to its users.

As with automobile engines, different types of consensus mechanisms are available to blockchain architects when designing a protocol. The choice of which to use reveals much about which attributes in [The Blockchain Trilemma](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism#the-blockchain-trilemma) trade-off are considered a priority. As a chain's consensus mechanism is so important, for _Sovereign Grade_ systems, it is the very last thing that should be on the chopping block when it comes to design constraints and security trade-offs.

The first popular blockchain, Bitcoin, uses Proof of Work, a relatively simple, tried and true consensus mechanism that essentially converts electricity into security. Proof of Work is empirically and theoretically secure from an economic game theory perspective. Even in the face of disruption from nation-states, history has shown that it can stave off attacks.

## [No Free Lunch](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#no-free-lunch)

An alternative consensus mechanism to Proof of Work that became popular is Proof of Stake, which became a "must have feature" for many second-generation blockchain projects. Instead of converting electricity into hashrate and security, Proof of Stake has been described as "virtual mining," where stakers lock up capital in return for the ability to create blocks and can claim a block reward by doing so. Again, the primary justification for Proof of Stake is environmentalism. It was hoped that Proof of Stake would provide the same or better security guarantees than Proof of Work without consuming large amounts of energy.

Straight off the bat, the idea that Proof of Stake would provide not just the same but _better_ security guarantees than Proof of Work, with not just the same but _less_ energy expenditure, should have rung alarm bells for those who understand that _there is no such thing as a free lunch_. But, for many, this essential truth was able to be hand-waved away, as the interdisciplinary convolutions of different Proof of Stake systems created a kind of technological [gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop), where fixes upon fixes made Proof of Stake protocols increasingly complex and obscure moving targets that became difficult to unpack. The _free lunch_ myth was able to be smuggled along.

## [Security Trade-offs](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#security-trade-offs)

The claim that "Proof of Stake is more secure than Proof of Work," is a "[not even wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong)" statement due to the nuance in the definition of "secure," and how to square this off with the plurality of Proof of Stake systems that have their own economic, social and technical trade-offs.

A Google spreadsheet cannot be 51% attacked, but does this make it "more secure" than Bitcoin? The answer to this is "it depends on what you mean by _secure._" In the case of Blockchain systems, as [explored](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism), it depends on whether a robust, decentralized, permissionless system can stand the test of time and achieve _Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance_. A Google spreadsheet for this kind of security is far, far _less_ "secure" than Bitcoin, as it can be taken over by a single party, Google, with zero effort.

In this sense, Proof of Stake is much like a Google spreadsheet. Lack of clarity around security guarantees, and the difficulty in measuring them, makes it impossible for even the highly technical users to see past the marketing claims made by many Proof of Stake projects. As a result, these systems’ true nature and potential failure modes are obfuscated compared with the explicit, well-understood, and less complicated guarantees of Proof of Work systems.

As each Proof of Stake system has its unique flaws, appraising them individually is impractical. Still, some general problems are more or less applicable to all Proof of Stake systems compared to Proof of Work. Some of these issues are explored below to demonstrate that chains implicitly make trade-offs that decide to use Proof of Stake over Proof of Work.

### [Self-Referential Security](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#self-referential-security)

Proof of Work is unique in that it can objectively bridge the gap between the "real world" and the "digital world" using the common language of compute cycles, which, when translated into hashrate, can be verified trustlessly by software. Furthermore, blockchains that use Proof of Work rely on unforgeable measurements from outside their system to reach consensus about their internal state, converting energy into security in the most direct and efficient way, while offloading the responsibility of generating those measurements to the outside world.

Proof of Work is very much like a combustion engine that consumes energy and converts it into valuable work in the form of security for the chain, incentivizing honest mining and ensuring that 51% of attacks are costly.

![engine](./engine.jpeg)

Proof of Work Engine

Instead of sourcing security from outside their system, Proof of Stake blockchains are secured by self-referencing their own state, and, as such, these protocols onboard additional responsibilities, complexity, and attack surface that can compromise how this security is generated.

This self-referencing of security can be described as a kind of perpetual motion machine that breaks the laws of thermodynamics. On the surface, the veil of complexity may trick observers into assuming it can self-sustain for a long period, but in reality, an unnoticed constraint means it is bound to grind to a halt in the not too distant future.

![image](./image.jpeg)

Proof of Stake Perpetual Motion Machine


### [Complexity and Attack Surface](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#complexity-and-attack-surface)

As with all software systems, additional complexity creates a greater attack surface for malicious actors to take advantage of and exploit, with potentially catastrophic results. In the context of blockchains, which are economical and software systems, this problem is compounded, and many of the potential exploits that lay dormant in such systems may not appear until a significant economic value is at risk.

Subtle game theory bugs and exploits in blockchains are extremely difficult, in some cases impossible to identify, test, and eliminate before going into production. One major defense is adhering to the sound technical principle of [Keep It Simple, Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), an approach abandoned by Proof of Stake projects when they reject the simple elegance Proof of Work and embrace more complex and exploitable alternatives that offer little to no pragmatic benefit to the network.

### [Unbalance of Power](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#unbalance-of-power)

As [explored earlier](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/decentralism/#balancing-power), removing miners from a blockchain's socioeconomic model takes away an important regulating force that would otherwise prevent capture, keeping other parties honest through the threat of vetoing poor decisions by the selective mining of chains. On Proof of Stake chains, investors, and "miners" (stakers) are the same group, so any abuse of power by this group remains relatively unchecked, and the chain is likely to tend to fork in ways that benefit this group at the expense of others, such as by increasing staking rewards.

### [Money isn't Power](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#money-isnt-power)

The ultimate security source on Proof of Work networks is a combination of electricity and hardware manufacturing distribution. Both of these are distributed geographically, and for large Proof of Work networks like Bitcoin, the resources required to muster an attack against the network are outside the means of any worldly organization, including nation-states. They either do not have enough electricity going spare and cannot secure the hardware required to mount an attack.

This is why the high energy usage of the Proof of Work network is not “wasted." Instead, the high energy usage secures the network against attack by making such attacks prohibitively expensive or logistically impossible.

In contrast, Proof of Stake chains are vulnerable to a whole suite of economic attacks thanks to modern financial weaponry and the value of the network being directly tied to security through staking. Unlike mining hardware and electricity capital can be printed out of thin air in fiat systems. The economic levers available to central banks and other organizations that may be threatened by blockchain technology are vast and sophisticated. The value of all Proof of Stake networks combined is a tiny drop compared to the broader economy, which has massive swathes of liquid capital that can be borrowed, leveraged, and put to use by a single just a single company with a chip on its shoulder.

Modern financial institutions threatened by blockchain technology are sure to wage economic war against Proof of Stake and cannot just mess with the price but potentially cause a system failure. By creating derivative markets and manipulating prices, they can buy up voting rights on the network and destroy or manipulate the ability to reach consensus through staking attacks.

### [Miner Attrition vs. The Rich Get Richer](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#miner-attrition-vs-the-rich-get-richer)

In Proof of Work systems, miners continually upgrade hardware, expending additional resources to remain competitive beyond ongoing electricity costs. The effect of this is that the pool of individuals who can mine is constantly shifting. If miner are bad at mining, they will eventually lose their ability to mine profitably as they are out-competed by other miners.

This is good for decentralization, as a constantly shifting pool of miners means that no one miner can hold on to a significant portion of a network for any significant amount of time unless they are actively working in the best interests of the network by providing ever-increasing amounts of hashrate. To achieve this, miners must invest in research and development, infrastructure, and scaling up operations, all the while paying close attention to happenings in the social layer, deciding how to balance power and which forks to mine.

This vital and multifaceted role is lobotomized from Proof of Stake systems. Instead, replacing this constant struggle with the relatively static figure of how much stake a given staker has access to, with very little to be gained by investing in innovation or other externalities. How much a staker profits or losses are entirely within their control, and, by doing nothing, they can increase their stack with no risk of being out-competed continually.

On top of this, due to economies of scale, gas fees, and the proportion of funds that must be staked compared to the funds that must be used for day to day living costs, in Proof of Stake systems, _the rich get richer_ at a _faster rate_, which centralizes the distribution of a network's value towards the richest stakers over time.

With no attrition force to correct this trend, lack of turnover in the staking ecosystem means that a power-block of mega-whales accumulates an ever-increasing portion of all Proof of Stake networks, making them increasingly susceptible to take over as the Nakamoto coefficient approaches 0. There is no reason that rent-seeking Proof of Stake staking dynasties don't continue for generations, as big stakers pass their increasingly large bags to the next generation, making it just a matter of time before Proof of Stake networks are explicitly captured the value in the network and the power to decide winning forks is drawn to the top.

### [Not Permissionless](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#not-permissionless)

Permissionlessness, unsurprisingly, is a property that allows new users to onboard into a system without the permission of someone already in said system. All other things being equal, permissionless systems can be more decentralized over time than permission systems, as they are indiscriminately open to new participants.

Mining, and in turn, Proof of Work, is permissionless, as anyone (or anything) can contribute hashrate to the network and have an equal chance of being able to mine a block based on the hashrate they contribute. Each hash is like a lottery ticket, and the more tickets purchased the higher the chance of finding a block and getting that sweet, sweet block reward.

Because there are no gatekeepers, Proof of Work consensus mechanisms _can't_ care _how_ hashrate is created or _who_ contributed. This is an essential quality if a chain is to remain neutral and uncaptured because if gatekeepers did exist, they would be able to reject work based on a contributor's identity or location, locking them out, and by doing so, centralizing, and capturing the network.

Proof of Stake systems are _not_ permissionless. The only way to acquire currency needed to transact and stake is by _buying_ it from someone who already has said currency. They need _permission_ from someone inside the network to use the network with existing holders being the gatekeepers.

In a sense, all Proof of Stake networks are already _soft captured_, as holders of Proof of Stake coins could collectively decide (or be coerced) to stop trading with users from some particular class or jurisdiction, and these users have no way to make transactions on the network regardless of the price they are willing to pay.

Take the example of a person from a less developed or sanctioned nation with little to no ability to transact in dollars; without access to the banking system, and thus onboarding through exchanges, and with nobody willing to do an OTC deal in cash in their area, they can always acquire Proof of Work currencies by simply purchasing some hardware to mine it. This same user is locked out on a Proof of Stake network, making the network less accessible, less useful, and less valuable.

### [Centralization of Staking on Exchanges](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#centralization-of-staking-on-exchanges)

The high technical barrier and _fear of messing up_ when running a node and manually staking makes it out of reach for the vast majority of casual holders in the crypto space, so almost all are likely to use third-party services, usually exchanges to stake.

Staking on exchanges is strictly better from a user experience perspective. It has the additional benefit of allowing users to instantly unstake funds with no penalty, as sizable excess liquidity will enable exchanges to arbitrage the lock-up period that most Proof of Stake chains impose, on behalf of users.

The result is that for most Proofs of Stake blockchains, exchanges will, and probably already do, handle the vast majority of a staking activity. This seriously undermines the illusion of decentralization on these projects and makes the capture of the chain far more likely.

To illustrate, consider the following plausible scenario:

If an "undesirable" application is operating on a large Proof of Stake chain, a government or powerful multinational organization could compel all exchanges under their authority to simultaneously freeze the funds of that chain, and assuming they hold a certain threshold of staked assets between them. They could then use this portion of the stake to push forward a hard fork of their choice, holding the chain to ransom and censoring whichever applications they desire.

In Proof of Work, this kind of attack is impossible thanks to the separation of concerns and the geographically decentralized nature of electricity sources.

### [The APR Arms Race](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#the-apr-arms-race)

Proof of Stake chains competes with each other for liquid staking capital that, unlike mining hardware that is bound to specific algorithms, can freely move between _all_ Proof of Stake chains by trading in open markets. This means that over time, all Proof of Stake chains will compete with each other, with a pressure to increase staking rewards and inflate rate, to entice enough stakers to stake on their chain. As a result, a "race to the bottom" will likely engulf all Proof of Stake chains as they enter into an ever-increasing _APR arms race_.

For example, if Chain A offers a 12% staking reward, why would stakers stake Chain B's 3% reward, when they could simply stake A and sell those rewards for B, ending up with more B than they would by staking B directly? This forces chain B to increase their reward, which then encourages A to do the same, and so on.

This situation is excellent for large stakers, but terrible for users who have some portion of their funds not staked to use the network, who will be taxed exorbitant fees for simply not staking. How this plays out is unknowable, but it risks damaging the utility and value of the network, leading to a death spiral of ever-increasing debasement.

### [33% Attacks](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#33-attacks)

Proof of Stake chains can be permanently disrupted if an attacker acquires 33% of staked assets, necessarily less than 33% of all coins.

So, if the average Proof of Stake protocol has 70%+ of its tokens staked, you’d need to acquire ~25% of the protocol’s total outstanding tokens to launch an attack. Although every Proof of Stake is different, 33% is generally only enough to halt the chain, so it can’t reach a consensus and produce new blocks, not to perform a double spend. So, for that, you would need a whopping 66%.

-   [Viktor Bunin](https://viktorbunin.medium.com/proof-of-stakes-security-model-is-being-dramatically-misunderstood-4ed7b19ca419)

Some argue that there is no _direct_ economic incentive to cause such an attack because the attacker risks devaluing their holdings, which may be true, but this is also an admission that Proof of Stake chains are susceptible to 33% halting via _indirect_ economic incentives such as shorting. More importantly, Proof of Stake chains are susceptible to 33% attacks from actors such as nation-states, where financial incentives are not the motivation, suggesting that _Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance_ is not an object of concern.

### [Perpetually Pure Pwnage](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#perpetually-pure-pwnage)

Proof of Stake's _33% attack_ is a much bigger problem than Proof of Work's _51% attack_, the latter of which is not permeant as it has an ongoing external electricity cost, making them impractically expensive to perform for sustained periods.

While 51% of Proof of Work systems attacks can be damaging, they only really directly affect those exposed to double spends (mostly exchanges, and not long-term holders who do not transact frequently). Moreover, because 51% of attacks have an up-front cost and are, unlike 33% of attacks, not guaranteed to be successful, there is diminished incentive to perform them, let alone persist.

On Proof of Stake chains, once an attacker achieves a certain threshold of stake, the chain can never recover; as the attacker does not need to commit external resources, they cannot be unseated. The only solution to this failure state is hard-forking away the attacker, which breaks _Code is Law_, defeats the purpose of having a blockchain, adds subjectivity, and further centralizes the chain.

### [Nothing at Stake](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#nothing-at-stake)

In Proof of Work, if a fork occurs, miners have to decide which side of a fork to mine as there is an external electricity cost associated with the creation of blocks. If miners mine the "wrong" fork, their reward will become valueless, and they will have wasted the electricity spent mining it, so they must choose what to mine wisely. There is the _cost of electricity_ at stake.

In contrast, on Proof of Stake, if a fork happens, the staked resources, being part of the system’s internal state, are split across the fork and are doubled. Stakers have equal assets on both sides of a fork and are incentivized to validate both sides, as they are unsure which side will prevail. This is known as the [nothing at stake problem](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-proof-of-stake-the-nothing-at-stake-theory-1f0d71bc027). It is likely to encourage forks by making it cheaper to fork, making it easier to attack chains through fork-based shenanigans, and complicating reaching consensus about which side of a split is the "true" version.

It is commonly claimed that the concept of _slashing_ is a solution to the nothing at stake problem, a technique that uses cryptographic proofs to punish stakers that validate the "wrong" side of a split. This is all well and good but slashing only works when forks are running protocols that validate each other's proofs.

An attacker could push for a controversial hard fork that intentionally made the fork's slashing proof invalid on the old version of the chain, optionally making reverse untrue and re-introducing the nothing at stake problem while encouraging validators to validate both chains, sowing chaos and splitting the value of the network.

Unlike a malicious Proof of Work fork where miners would waste electricity mining the new fork, validators on this new Proof of Stake fork not only might as well validate it, as there is nothing at stake, but are incentivized to do so as it could well end up being the winning chain.

### [Disrupted Dispute Resolution](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#disrupted-dispute-resolution)

Alternatively, assuming that both sides of a split _do_ recognize each other's slashing proofs, the chain then has a different problem: the resolution of legitimate differences in opinion that would result in chain split on Proof of Work networks.

Ethereum Classic is an excellent example of this "ultimate dispute resolution" mechanism in Proof of Work chains, as explained no better than on the [Ethereum.org website](https://ethereum.org/en/governance/#dao-fork).

While heavily dependent on implementation details of the protocol, in general, Proof of Stake changes the dynamic of hard forking in favor of the majority stakers over the underdogs and, in many cases, simply destroys the underdog chain, forcing them to hard fork to a new protocol if they disagree with a controversial fork.

Unlike in Proof of Work, where the classic chain enjoys the advantage of maintaining the status quo and miners having to actively make a switch to a new fork, on Proof of Stake chains, the majority of forkers have the advantage, as the legacy side of a controversial fork has to implement their defensive hard forks to avoid being slashed on future forks. New forks enjoy the option of either slashing or not-slashing validators on the old chain, optimizing the punishment of laggards to get their desired outcome, and manipulating the economics of a hard fork decision.

_Note: The following three Proof of Stake criticisms are from [etherplan.com](https://etherplan.com/2019/10/07/why-proof-of-stake-is-less-secure-than-proof-of-work/9077/)_

### [Subjective fork choice](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#subjective-fork-choice)

The fork choice is the decision rule network participants have to use when presented with more than one chain when it splits, when they join for the first time, or when they leave and enter again. As an external physical signal, Proof of Work enables a clear objective fork choice in the form of the “longest proof of work chain.” It is objective because only with the computing power of the whole network is that the longest chain can be established.

As Proof of Stake systems don’t count with such an objective quantity to decide the correct chain, they have to use a subjective decision-making process by the participants. This means they need to consult off chain with block explorers, developers, miners, or other sources to decide what chain to follow. This applies to participating nodes in the network, new entrants, and nodes who leave and join again in the case of splits.

### [Unforgivable Costliness](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#unforgible-costilness)

One of the fundamental physical features of sound money is that it is very costly to produce to guarantee it can’t be forged. Proof of Work provides this costliness of the tokens as miners incur massive costs, in data centers and electricity to build blocks. This makes Proof of Work tokens, as $ETC and $BTC, unforgeable in practice.

It is simple to objectively verify that a holder's BTC or ETC is not counterfeit because an external objective measurement is embedded into every block header. Still, this proof does not exist in Proof of Stake systems. In Proof of Stake systems, because the database with accounts and balances is trivial to write by nodes and stakers in the system, there is no objective costliness, and verifying the authenticity holdings is far more complex, error-prone, and potentially requires expensive hardware.

### [Accumulated Work](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#accumulated-work)

As miners in Proof of Work blockchains work on a block-by-block basis, that work is not only a barrier for dishonest nodes to tamper with the current or latest blocks, but that work accumulates as the chain is built. This means blocks buried further away in the chain become exponentially more difficult for attackers to change or forge. For example, at the time of this writing, it would take 340 days with 100% of the current hashing power in the Bitcoin network to reverse the entire chain.

In Proof of Stake distributed ledgers because they don’t use Proof of Work, reverse the entire chain is trivial in terms of computational work, so it can be done in a few minutes.

## [Hotel Towels](https://ethereumclassic.org/why-classic/proof-of-work#hotel-towels)

Even if the environmentalist argument for Proof of Stake is taken at face value, it is clear that Proof of Stake requires chains to sacrifice some security guarantees otherwise provided by Proof of Work. Proof of Stake chains trade away censorship resistance in return for the promise of less energy consumption. Aside from marketing gimmicks, a trade-off seems to make little sense when pragmatically evaluating the responsibility and utility of blockchains compared to other available technologies. There is no free lunch, after all.

But when the environmentalist claim is _not_ taken at face value, the choice to use Proof of Stake starts to make sense. Much like a hotel that requests that guests reuse towels to "save the planet," the Proof of Stake environmentalist position is conveniently one that also happens to enrich the holders of said currencies, who can generate passive income by staking, in their eyes, reaping the rewards by providing the very same service that miners would otherwise provide. "Virtual mining” with next to no expense other than the opportunity cost of locking up the stake.

Well-intentioned or otherwise, this massive economic incentive explains why despite the security downgrades explored above, it is no wonder that Proof of Stake became such a popular choice among cryptocurrency holders and has managed to recruit many avid promoters.

Proof of Stake is like the hotel asking you to reuse towels to save the planet. On the surface, it's for noble intentions, but, in reality, it’s making them money and giving you a worse service.

For all the known downsides, the projects that nevertheless opt for Proof of Stake must either be _extremely_ concerned about energy usage or possibly more believably, are primarily concerned that staking will economically benefit stakers. However, this concern is misguided, as a project can only have long term-value if it provides utility, which is undermined by the centralization and trade-offs necessitated by Proof of Stake.

It may be that holders of such coins believe they are providing a comparable service to mining, but they are not converting a real-world expense into a security benefit, as with mining. Instead, they are _shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic_ by redistributing value from elsewhere in the network to themselves by taxing non-stakers through inflation.

In any case, because of the inherent trade-offs required in Proof of Stake systems, it is yet another sign that _Sovereign Grade Censorship Resistance_ is not a priority on these chains. As such, they cannot be recommended for deployments that have the potential to disrupt powerful incumbent institutions.
